The bulk of this project and a detailed javadoc comment explaining
the JoyUtil class can be found at the following link:

https://github.com/NotAYoutuberYT/JoyUtil/blob/main/src/main/java/frc/robot/JoyUtil.java

(You may see <> at the start of comments made by me - this is because my team uses
identifiers at the start of our comments so that we can easily identify who wrote
what code without the need for semi-cumbersome git shenanigans)
